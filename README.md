## Project Overview

**crazy_bankers** is a Flutter-based frontend developed for the SuRaksha Cyber Hackathon. It leverages behavioral biometrics (such as tap/sensor patterns) and integrates with Firebase for authentication and secure data storage. With a modular design, it supports Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

---

## Features

- **Multi-platform:** Runs on mobile, web, and desktop with a single codebase.
- **Firebase Integration:** Handles authentication, storage, and cloud sync.
- **Behavioral Authentication:** Uses device taps, gestures, and sensors for behavioral biometrics.
- **Device ID Management:** Associates users with device-unique identifiers.
- **Offline/Online Data Sync:** Local storage and background data transmission.
- **Secure Storage:** Uses platform-specific secure storage for sensitive data.

## Architecture & Deep Dive

### lib/ Directory Details

The `lib/` directory is the heart of the Flutter application, containing all core logic, UI, and platform integration:

- **main.dart**  
  The entry point of the app.
    - Initializes Firebase using options from `firebase_options.dart`
    - Loads/synchronizes device ID and user-specific behavioral models
    - Handles "remember me" login and launches the main UI

- **firebase_options.dart**  
  Auto-generated by FlutterFire CLI.
    - Stores all Firebase configuration for different platforms
    - Ensures seamless cross-platform Firebase initialization

- **constants.dart**  
  Contains design constants and reusable styles for UI consistency (e.g., font styles, colors for login pages).

- **controller/**  
  Houses GetX controllers for UI state and business logic (e.g., authentication, navigation, etc.).

- **device_id/**  
  Manages device UUID retrieval and persistence for tying behavioral data to physical devices.

- **dio_controller/**  
  Manages HTTP requests, networking, and API interactions using the Dio package.

- **helpers/**  
  Utility classes and background task handlers.
    - `data_transmitters/`: Modules for sending sensor/biometric data to the backend, both offline and real-time.

- **login_screens/**  
  UI and logic for registration, login, and user onboarding screens.

- **main_ui/**  
  The main app UI post-login (e.g., HomePage, dashboards, navigation).

- **models/**  
  Contains Dart classes for behavioral models, such as Siamese networks for tap authentication.

- **orchestrator/**  
  Coordinates data flow and system operations between components (e.g., synchronizing auth, sensors, and cloud).

- **stats_collectors/**  
  Collects tap, gesture, and sensor statistics for behavioral biometrics.

- **stats_screens/**  
  Displays collected statistics and analytics in the UI.
